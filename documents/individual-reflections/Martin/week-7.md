# Individual reflection: Week 7

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I've learned very, very much about Firebase and how to use it. I've also learned about Kivy and KivyMD, especially the Material Design guidelines that I had never used before this project. I've also learned about using Kivy on Android, including how Buildozer and Python-for-Android work, as well as the struggles in transpiling a C library to ARMv7 that isn't directly designed for it.
B: Learning any and all new tools and technologies used for the project in order to be as productive as possible when developing on any part of the application/software.
A -> B: Putting in work, working hands-on with all the tools and technologies.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: I had more experience with Python than most other people on the team, so I could help a lot with teaching about coding in Python. I was also the one who set up and configured our CI setup, so I could answer all questions about how it worked and how we can make use of it.
B: I want to be knowledgeable about many things, so that I can discuss things with other team members and help us all learn something by helping the project progress faster. I also should be an active communicator so that I am available for people to ask questions in case they want to know something.
A -> B: Learn about many tools/technologies that are used so that I can help others user them, and communicate with others who need help so that they can actually get help with learning whatever they need.

### What is my contribution towards the team's user of Scrum?
A: I took part in the daily scrums on nearly every day during the project (there were a few I missed). I also actively contributed to the teams retrospective reflections. Beyond these basic requirements, also helped with the actual development process, such as sprint planning and writing user stories and issues/tasks.
B: I want to be an active team member who helps the team use the scrum process for what it is; an agile framework for structuring a teams work.
A -> B: Keep practicing, after all scrum and agile in general are meant to be fairly lightweight tools to help teams organize themselves. I need to make it more routine-like to work in this framework.

### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: I've developed a lot of code, developed and maintained the entire CI pipeline, worked a lot on the Firebase backend code and structure. I've completed my fair share of user stories/corresponding tasks.
B: To do my share of the assigned work and also help others in case they get stuck, all while not burning out on the project or task by working too much either.
A -> B: Keep going with the development work and effort, although some weeks during this project clearly went overboard with regard to the number of hours spent on project work. The last 2 weeks were both 60+ hour weeks, but many of those hours went into investigating and learning about tools such as Buildozer and Firebase, and didn't go directly to actually producing any code or other work. Keeping these big weeks to a minimum and maybe spreading the work out more should lead to a better balance and high productivity overall, because being tired and/or stressed doesn't help me perform any better.
