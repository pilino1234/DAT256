# Individual reflection: Week 1

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn more about Kivy (the frontend library we are going to use) and
some other tools and libraries we are going to use for the project, such as
yapf, sphinx, presumable nosetests for unit testings, etc.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I have quite a lot of experience with Python, as well as git and GitHub, so that
should help. I also have a fair amount of experience with databases, specifically
PostgreSQL and SQL in general, so that will probably be useful too.

### What is my contribution towards the team's user of Scrum?

Since our team is using Slack for communication, I looked at some of the
availabe Scrum apps for Slack, which we will try to use for coordinating remote
daily scrums and other parts of the process.
So far, we have only had the LEGO exercise for actually using Scrum, but that
went quite well and everyone on the team who was there seemed to get the hang of
it quite quickly. So I'm positive that it will go well once we start the actual
project in a few weeks.

### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries
So far, we have only been discussing some project ideas. Although I haven't
come up with any of my own ideas, I feel that I have contributed a fair amount
of ideas and suggestions towards the ideas that were put forward.
