# Individual reflection: Week 4

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: This is still mostly the same as last week; I want to learn more about Firebase, but I've gotten a bit more comfortable with Kivy.
B: I want to be quite fluent in using all the technologies used in our.project, so that i can be maximally productive.
A -> B: As always when it comes to programming; sitting down, getting your feet wet, reading docs, and just working with the tools and libs. (So, still the same as last week. This process will probably be the same for quite some time ahead)

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: I've got knowledge about python and our CI setup that is undoubtedly useful for the group. I've started working on my assigned tasks that have to do with linking frontend and backend. Now that the project backend is more or less set up, I'll probably be the first to actually implement a feature making use of this. From that, I'll probably learn quite a lot of useful hints, tips and tricks that others can make use of.
B: I want to be knowledgeable about most, if not everything, in our project if at all possible.
A -> B: Learning the ropes; get used to all the libs and technologies in use, especially how to utilize firebase.

### What is my contribution towards the team's user of Scrum?
A: We have digital daily scrums that I take part in. We also have the first sprint review coming up, so that will be interesting.
B: Understanding the scrum process and being able to apply it to create a productive environment to develop a project successfully.
A -> B: Practice using scrum, we're in the final stretch of sprint 1 now, with the spritn review and sprint 2 coming up next week.

### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: I've helped getting our development infrastructure up and running, including checks, tests and deployment via Travis CI. However, I've been lagging behind a bit on contributing code, because of what my assigned tasks deal with. The backend was not fully operational for quite a while, but now it should be good to go.
B: I want to be an active contributor and developer of our teams codebase, with understanding of the architecture and protocols in use.
A -> B: Now that the backend is functional, I can finish development of my assigned tasks and push them to GitHub for review and merging.
