# Individual reflection: Week 5

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: This is still mostly the same as last week; I want to learn more about Firebase. I've gotten used to our software architecture and
B: I want to be quite fluent in using all the technologies used in our project, so that I can be maximally productive no matter which area of the code I'm working on.
A -> B: Keep learning about Firebase, which is probably going to come into action for real during the next sprint. We have all the infrastructure setup completed now, we can actually focus on implementing features making use of these Firebase features now.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: I've got knowledge about python and our CI setup that is undoubtedly useful for the group. I've started working on my assigned tasks that have to do with linking frontend and backend. I've worked quite a bit with our client-side Firebase code as well, so I can help people understand what it is doing and how to use it. I also have a good overview of the model and presenter parts of our code.
B: I want to be knowledgeable about as many parts of our project as possible so that I can answer most questions.
A -> B: Learning about Firebase auth and store (for images), as well as some more detailed knowledge of implementing views with Kivy.

### What is my contribution towards the team's user of Scrum?
A: We have digital daily scrums that I take part in. I also contributed with my personal thoughts during the retrospective reflection after our first sprint.
B: Understanding the scrum process and being able to apply it to create a productive environment to develop a project successfully.
A -> B: Practice using scrum, we're at the end of the second sprint now, so we have another sprint review coming up on Monday.

### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: I've helped getting our development infrastructure up and running, including checks, tests and deployment via Travis CI. This week I've also gotten back on track with delivering my own assigned tasks, as well as helping out other people with improving their code, reviewing PRs and merging PRs.
B: I want to be an active contributor and developer of our teams codebase, with understanding of the architecture and protocols in use.
A -> B: I feel like I'm quite close to point B now, although I could probably improve a bit more in certain areas. Personally I feel that I could be quicker with responding to requested reviews, as well as responding to reviewer requests on my own code.
