# Individual reflection: Week 

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

This is mostly the same as last week; I want to learn more about Kivy 
(the frontend library we are going to use) and some other tools and libraries 
we are going to use for the project, such as yapf, sphinx, presumable nosetests 
for unit testings, etc.
I am trying to set up a CI configuration that allows us to deploy our code as
a .apk file and release it to GitHub, but I need to understand Docker and 
Buildozer a bit better before I can get it to work.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I'm working on learning Buildozer, which is the tool we will need to use to 
build an app from our code. This will be very useful for the team.
I have quite a lot of experience with Python, as well as git and GitHub, so that
should help. I also have a fair amount of experience with databases, specifically
PostgreSQL and SQL in general, so that will probably be useful too.

### What is my contribution towards the team's user of Scrum?

We have continued discussing the workflow in our team, and although the actual
implementation phase of the project has not started yet, we have already been 
preparing for using scrum later on by writing user stories, and process that I 
was involved in quite a lot.

### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries

I have helped with writing the user stories and developing our idea for the project
by giving feedback and discussing, mainly through Slack. I have also been a lot more
active and available on Slack this week, which aids the teams process so that there
is somebody available to discuss things with.
