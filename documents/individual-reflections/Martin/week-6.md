# Individual reflection: Week 6

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I have learned a bit about how Buildozer works under the hood, in order to be able to debug/fix the issue of not being to actually run the app on a phone. I've also gotten involved in Firebase development a bit.
B: I mainly want to be able to solve the problem with Buildozer and APKs. I also want to understand Firebase better so that I know what I'm doing.
A -> B: Keep learning about Buildozer and python-for-android, as well as Firebase.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: I've got knowledge about python, our CI setup, and Buildozer that is undoubtedly useful for the group.
B: I want to be knowledgeable about as many parts of our project as possible so that I can answer most questions.
A -> B: Learning about Firebase auth and store (for images), as well as some more detailed knowledge of implementing views with Kivy. I always want to learn more about python-for-android and Buildozer so that I can help the team solve the current issues we're facing.

### What is my contribution towards the team's user of Scrum?
A: We have digital daily scrums that I take part in. I also contributed with my personal thoughts during the retrospective reflection after our first sprint.
B: Understanding the scrum process and being able to apply it to create a productive environment to develop a project successfully.
A -> B: Practice using scrum, we're at the end of the third sprint now, so we have another sprint review coming up on Monday.

### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: I've helped getting our development infrastructure up and running, including checks, tests and deployment via Travis CI. This is helping now that we're trying to get APKs to work, because I initially set up the entire system.
B: I want to be an active contributor and developer of our teams codebase, with understanding of the architecture and protocols in use. I also want to be good at working with the CI/devops infrastructure that we've got going.
A -> B: Keep going like right now.
