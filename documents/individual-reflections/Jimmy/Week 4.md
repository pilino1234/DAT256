# Individual Reflection
### Week 4

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I'm getting into the syntax of Python and Kivy, which makes it easier to keep a somewhat even flow.
B: I want to be able to manipulate the components of Kivy and KivyMD at a deeper level, so that I can build more customized components that fit our needs.
A -> B: I'm going to keep working with Kivy, and study the language documentation to better understand how to customize components.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: Git, and all of its endless possibilities, is still making team members stuggle a little bit.
B: I can help out with workflows and commands needed to perform basic operations.
A -> B: I'll be available to answer questions and show how to use the desktop client and command line tools.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A: We're currently doing daily standups, as well as a weekly meeting. I attend them and I am active during the meetings.
B: I'd like to better understand the Scrum workflow, so that I can make well informed suggestions on how to improve our work in the group.
A -> B: I'll dig into a few articles online, to try to learn more about how Scrum is executed in other workplaces and what experiences and thoughts others have.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A: I put up my first merge request, containing a detail view for the application. It's still awaiting feedback and approval.
B: I'd like to contribute with yet another user story before the end of next week.
A -> B: I'm going to start on another card from our board and finish it before the end of next week.
