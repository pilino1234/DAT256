# Individual Reflection
### Week 9

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: Right now, I'm at a point where I feel comfortable with my abilities to work with the technologies we've used during this project. I also feel like I'm understanding the agile methodologies and scrum well enough to evaluate their up- and downsides, as well as use them (or some modification of them) to make the teams work more efficient.
B: I would like to continue to refine my understanding of the pros and cons of scrum. As of now, it seems like it has it's time and it's place, but it's not a silver bullet.
A -> B: I will use the knowledge I've acquired in my day job, where I can also get some perspective of what alternatives there are, and what modifications one can make to the workflow to better fit a department that is not working in such strict sprints.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: The team has made some serious progress from week 1 up until now. I'm very impressed by how the individuals have developed and how the team has grown together during these weeks. I'm especially happy that we managed to maintain an openness towards each other, and kept a feeling of "it's fine to ask for help".
B, A -> B: I especially want to hold on to the mindset that it is okay to ask for help if you need it. It's a mindset that I'm actively reminded of at my current employer, and it is something that I believe that a team can gain great advantages from.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A: Compared to the first sprint, our evaluations / retrospectives have become much more efficient. People have gone from being all over the place, to actually trying to focus on the tasks at hand. I've learned a lot about what it takes to lead such a meeting in an effective manner.
B, A -> B: I'd like to get even better at leading a team in these situations, so I will take on more resposibility in leading team meetings and help my team to make the most out of them, while minimizing the time spent.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This past sprint has mostly been about making sure we're ready for the demonstration and that the app is working well for all intents and purposes it was meant for. My contribution has mostly consisted of making smaller bug fixes and testing of user flows that we wish to demonstrate, which is something that I will continue to do during the weekend.
