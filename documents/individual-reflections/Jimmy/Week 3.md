# Individual Reflection
### Week 3

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I feel like I'm spending a lot of time just looking up syntax at the moment, and it messing with my flow.
B: I want to understand how to use the Kivy framework better, so that I can use it in a more effective manner. I'd also like to learn Python a little better, so that I don't need to spend as much time looking up basic syntax.
A -> B: I'm going to get my hands dirty with a Kivy tutorial so that I can get a sense of how it's supposed to work.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: We are currently starting to use Git for real, and since a few of the members in the group have limited experience with it, it may slow down their work.
B: I can help out with workflows and commands needed to perform basic operations.
A -> B: I'll be available to answer questions and show how to use the desktop client and command line tools.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A: We're currently doing daily standups, as well as a weekly meeting. I attend them and I am active during the meetings.
B: I'd like to better understand the Scrum workflow, so that I can make well informed suggestions on how to improve our work in the group.
A -> B: I'm going to reflect and ponder about the different parts of Scrum, and what their purpose is in the workflow, so that I can make decisions and suggestions based on a better understanding of what the steps are really trying to accomplish.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A: I checked, polished and sorted the user stories, as well as imported them into our Github scrum board. I've downloaded and set up Kivy on my computer (took a lot longer than I expected) and started learning the structure and syntax of it.
B: I'd like to finish up my first user story, so that I can get that feeling that I've accomplished something concrete in the project.
A -> B: I'm going to finish my first user story in the next few days, so that I can move on to a new one and feel like I'm "in the game".
