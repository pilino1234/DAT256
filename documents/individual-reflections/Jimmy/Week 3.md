# Individual Reflection
### Week 3

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * I want to understand how to use the Kivy framework better, so that I can use it in a more effective manner. I'd also like to learn Python a little better, so that I don't need to spend as much time looking up basic syntax. 

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  * Since we are currently starting to use Git for real, I can help out with the workflow and commands needed to perform basic operations.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * I "attended" all the daily standups we had this week, as well as the weekly meeting where we discussed and decided on a basic workflow for our deliveries.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * I checked, polished and sorted the user stories, as well as put them into our Github scrum board. I've downloaded and set up Kivy on my computer (took a lot longer than I expected) and started learning the structure and syntax of it.
