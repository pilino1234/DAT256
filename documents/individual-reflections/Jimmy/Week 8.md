# Individual Reflection
### Week 8

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I've learned enough Kivy to be able to work with it without getting stuck for long periods of time.
B: I would like to learn how to work with Firebase a bit better.
A -> B: I'm going to see if there is anything that I can do to make it easier for the members working with the Firebase integration.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: The team is getting more comfortable with the workflow we've established, and with the technologies at hand.
B: I feel like there are still a few question marks surrounding a few team members regarding the review process.
A -> B: I'll be available to answer questions and show how to use the desktop client and command line tools.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A: I attend meetings and actively participate in the evaluation and planning of our work.
B: We're still not quite there on estimating how much work we can get done in a week. I feel like we're still overestimating the amount of work that we're able to get done, considering the number of hours we have to work with. Considering that we're entering our last sprint for this project, we need to make sure that our next estimate is better and that we have a working product to demonstrate.
A -> B: I'm going to bring up my concerns on mondays meeting and make sure that we settle on a plan that is achievable.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A: I've finished the deliveries I was supposed to do, plus worked on another curve ball that needed fixing.
B: I'd like to make sure that the different parts of the app that we're suposed to demonstrate are working as they should.
A -> B: I'm going suggest taking on a QA role during the next sprint, to make sure that all user flows work the way they're supposed to.
