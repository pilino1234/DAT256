# Individual Reflection
### Week 1

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * Since we are going to write our project in Python, this gives me a great opportunity to learn a language that I've been looking at for some time.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  * Having experience in working with databases, I will be able to help the team in designing and constructing a reasonable database for the backend.
  
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * Since we have only done a few exercises in using Scrum, the main focus has been on understanding the mind set and make sure that the whole team share a similar understanding of it. So far, we seem to be doing very good and everyone seems to adapt the mind set very quickly.
  
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * I've been active in suggesting and discussing project ideas and the possible technologies surrounding each of them. I've been active and available in the communication channels we've set up for the team.
