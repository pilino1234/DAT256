# Individual Reflection
### Week 1

This week, the group met to agree on a social contract. We also started throwing around project ideas and looking at what technologies would aid in the development of different projects.<br>

When writing this, we are leaning towards making an app that makes it possible for users to post items that they need delivered some place. Other users will be able to see posted items, accept and perform a delivery for a small fee. Techonologies used in this project will largely build on Python, which will give me an opportunity to learn a language that I've been looking at for some time, but will also come with the absolute need to quickly learn the basics to be able to help out.
