# Individual Reflection
### Week 2

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * I want to learn and understand how to implement and tweak the agile workflow so that it works as good as possible for the team.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  * I can help the part of our team that is not as comfortable using Git how to perform basic operations that will speed up their workflow.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * I try to argue from a "do the smallest thing that works for now" perspective when organizing and splitting up our work, which makes our tasks smaller and a lot more defined in the end.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * This week, Elias and I put together the application mock up and the presentation slides, as well as put in feedback on both the business model canvas and the user stories we're writing.
