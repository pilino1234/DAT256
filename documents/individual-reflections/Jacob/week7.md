# Individual Reflection Week 7

* **what do I want to learn or understand better?**
    * A: Great understanding of Kivy, KivyMD and Firebase. Also now know Bing API and geopy which is what we went with instead of Google's map API. Why? Because it was free and easy to setup.
    * B: Great understanding of Kivy, KivyMD and Firebase. Good understanding of some map related API.
    * A->B: I feel pretty satisfied with what I have learnt actually. There is always more to learn, but I feel like I now know things that I desired from the start. The tools and such didn't end up being the exact names I thought they would be but the feature they bring is what matters and what I was actually searching for.

* **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
    * A: I've helped people with Kivy/KivyMD through PoC, resources, helping others in their development. I've also helped people to learn git / git workflows / GitHub (PR and suchs) and how the whole project is interconnected. Also some general web fundamentals. A lot of pair programming this last week which was very good.
    * B: Except for things mentioned in A, I'd say that pair programming is a very valuable technique to both learn and to teach. It's a way of being productive while learning from others.
    * A->B: Doing more pair programming I'd say. It is always a bit hard to know what is the best way to help others learn something new, but doing pair programming you often realize what others might need to learn. Things you didn't even think about normally but realize while you are coding together.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?**
    * A: Lecture exercises, setup scrum bot, active on Slack / general communication, scrum meetings, wrote user stories with Martin and Theodor, converted user stories to tasks with Jimmy. Have helped weight user stories. Have lead every scrum meeting we have had (agenda and so on).
    * B: I want to master the scrum technique and show that in practice while helping others do the same.
    * A->B: Probably should read more online about how other teams have used scrum and their hits/misses, their experience and opinions - since right now I mostly have my own experiences.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?**
    * A: Kivy PoC, very active in Slack/communication, navigation bar, lots of PR reviews, contributed to others' PR:s, helped a lot with writing documents (team reflections and such). Pretty much the leader for Kivy/KivyMD related development at this point. Also some firebase stuff. Last week Martin and were really stuck at dealing with APKs though. Essentially our app builds broke because python-for-android and we have been contacting the devs/admins of the project in order to fix the issues, but it has been really complicated/involved. Lots of C++ related compilation and deep-diving into the python-for-android project. We have learned a lot about the python-for-android project but it's been depressing having to spend such a huge amount of hours in order to fix this - without success (yet). We might have to skip mobile versions for the demonstration because of this, which sucks. This week was more productive but very stressful for me. Most of the stress has come from the account feature which I just wanted to be canceled since I didn't feel its low customer value supported its huge work time consumption. I ended up having to help out because some people didn't want to cancel it but still needed help to get totally stuck. Other than it has been mostly polishing stuff this week. This week and last week were pretty stressful. Before that it was a lot more pleasant.
    * B: Want to keep help contributing in a little bit of everything so that I have a good understanding of all the areas. That way I can help out with most questions on Slack. I also don't want to feel forced to work more than I should which is around ~20h/week.
    * A->B: I need to find ways to stop myself from trying to make sure that everything (even if it's not related to my assigned issues) gets done, since it ends up with me working too much and being unhealthy/stressed.
