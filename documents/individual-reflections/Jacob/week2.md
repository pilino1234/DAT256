# Individual Reflection Week 2

* what do I want to learn or understand better? **Kivy, the mobile framework we'll be using. I understand it well enough, but want to get into more advanced topics.**

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? **I have good understanding of git and how a good git workflow looks like, so I can help others with understanding those concepts. As I am trying to focus on learning Kivy right now I hope to be able to help out others developing the app as well.**

* what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum? **While writing user stories I started converting some of the stories to technical tasks/issues that we can later on put in to the product backlog.**

* what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? **I wrote user stories together with Martin and Theodor. I also helped developing the mockup and business canvas model through feedback.**
