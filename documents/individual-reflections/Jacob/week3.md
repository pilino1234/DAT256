# Individual Reflection Week 3

* **what do I want to learn or understand better?**
    * A: So far I've a pretty good understanding of Kivy and how we should go about using it. We realized that KivyMD is a thing, so I've gone and learnt that as well. I have an alright understanding of how to use Firebase, and have a good idea of the possibilities that it offers.
    * B: Great understanding of Kivy, KivyMD and Firebase. Good understanding of Google maps API.
    * A->B: Just getting some more experience using Kivy/KivyMD will probably solve that part. I need to eventually dive into the maps API but just figuring out the essentials that we'll need should take that long to study. Firebase depends mostly on getting hands-on experience but Theodor made a nice PoC regarding firebase so I've already gotten some.

* **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
    * A: I've helped people with Kivy through PoC and resources. I've also helped people to learn git / git workflows / GitHub (PR and suchs). Also some general web fundamentals.
    * B: I want to help others with KivyMD as well, as that might add some more complication to building the app (although it will also save a lot of time).
    * A->B: On Monday when we all meet together physically I will help people with KivyMD, and explain what it is.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?**
    * A: Lecture exercises, setup scrum bot, active on Slack / general communication, scrum meetings, wrote user stories with Martin and Theodor, converted user stories to tasks with Jimmy.
    * B: Want to contribute in formulating future user stories. Want to weight current stories.
    * A->B: weight current stories on Monday.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?**
    * A: Kivy PoC, very active in Slack/communication, navigation bar, PR reviews, helped alot with writing documents (team reflections and such).
    * B: more sprint issues / tasks.
    * A->B: find more time for solving tasks. There has been a lot of document writing, documentation reading and proof of concepts writing so far.
