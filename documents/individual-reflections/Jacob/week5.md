# Individual Reflection Week 4

* **what do I want to learn or understand better?**
    * A: Great understanding of Kivy and KivyMD by now. Good understind of Firebase. Haven't started with Google Maps API as that feature hasn't become relevant yet.
    * B: Great understanding of Kivy, KivyMD and Firebase. Good understanding of Google maps API (if we end up using it).
    * A->B: Firebase progress has been going great this week. Not only I, but I feel that most group members are pretty confident with it now. I might need to eventually dive into the maps API but just figuring out the essentials that we'll need should take that long to study.

* **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
    * A: I've helped people with Kivy/KivyMD through PoC, resources, helping others in their development. I've also helped people to learn git / git workflows / GitHub (PR and suchs) and how the whole project is interconnected. Also some general web fundamentals.
    * B: Nothing specific that needs to be taught, so staying very active on Slack is my goal.
    * A->B: Keep staying active on Slack.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?**
    * A: Lecture exercises, setup scrum bot, active on Slack / general communication, scrum meetings, wrote user stories with Martin and Theodor, converted user stories to tasks with Jimmy. Have helped weight user stories.
    * B: Want to contribute in formulating future user stories.
    * A->B: As for now, it is just a matter of waiting. If there is anything more scrum related that I need to do, then I am currently unaware of it.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?**
    * A: Kivy PoC, very active in Slack/communication, navigation bar, lots of PR reviews, contributed to others' PR:s, helped a lot with writing documents (team reflections and such). Pretty much the leader for Kivy/KivyMD related development at this point. Some of the firebase stuff now.
    * B: Want to keep help contributing in a little bit of everything so that I have a good understanding of all the areas. That way I can help out with most questions on Slack.
    * A->B: Pick user stories and tasks of varying nature.
