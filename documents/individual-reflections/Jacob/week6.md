# Individual Reflection Week 6

* **what do I want to learn or understand better?**
    * A: Great understanding of Kivy, KivyMD and Firebase. Haven't started with Google Maps API as that feature hasn't become relevant yet.
    * B: Great understanding of Kivy, KivyMD and Firebase. Good understanding of Google maps API (if we end up using it).
    * A->B: I might need to eventually dive into the maps API but just figuring out the essentials that we'll need should take that long to study.

* **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
    * A: I've helped people with Kivy/KivyMD through PoC, resources, helping others in their development. I've also helped people to learn git / git workflows / GitHub (PR and suchs) and how the whole project is interconnected. Also some general web fundamentals.
    * B: Nothing specific that needs to be taught, so staying very active on Slack is my goal.
    * A->B: Keep staying active on Slack.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?**
    * A: Lecture exercises, setup scrum bot, active on Slack / general communication, scrum meetings, wrote user stories with Martin and Theodor, converted user stories to tasks with Jimmy. Have helped weight user stories.
    * B: Want to contribute in formulating future user stories.
    * A->B: As for now, it is just a matter of waiting. If there is anything more scrum related that I need to do, then I am currently unaware of it.

* **what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?**
    * A: Kivy PoC, very active in Slack/communication, navigation bar, lots of PR reviews, contributed to others' PR:s, helped a lot with writing documents (team reflections and such). Pretty much the leader for Kivy/KivyMD related development at this point. Also some firebase stuff. This week Martin and I have been really stuck at dealing with APKs though. Essentially our app builds broke because python-for-android and we have been contacting the devs/admins of the project in order to fix the issues, but it has been really complicated/involved. Lots of C++ related compilation and deep-diving into the python-for-android project. We have learned a lot about the python-for-android project but it's been depressing having to spend such a huge amount of hours in order to fix this - without success (yet). We might have to skip mobile versions for the demonstration because of this, which sucks.
    * B: Want to keep help contributing in a little bit of everything so that I have a good understanding of all the areas. That way I can help out with most questions on Slack.
    * A->B: Pick user stories and tasks of varying nature. Will likely have to drop the APKs and just focus on polishing the app's desktop version.
