what do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I've come quite far but still don't quite understand all of how Kivy and Python works.

B: I want to have a good enough understanding of Kivy and Python work to be able to be creative and not feel constricted by random programming errors.

A -> B: I feel like the way forward here is to simply program more and continue improving on what I've already done. Learning by doing.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: I am a quite creative person but currently feel constricted by the programming language. I therefore have a hard time helping others make things look nice.

B: I want to be able to work creatively in Kivy and thereby inspire others by showing the way forward.

A -> B: Practice. And maybe learning some interaction design.

what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
A: Presently, I'm only contributing by doing the daily scrums like everyone else.

B: I want to contribute more actively somehow

A -> B: Together with Kevin, I will take on the role of product owner during the next sprint. This way I'll be able to contribute more.

what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: I'm almost there but still learning Kivy and Python. Therefore my contribution has been limited and almost entirely at the very end of the sprint.

B: By continuing to learn, I will be able to contribute more.

A -> B: Once again, the solution is to learn. I feel like that's going very well though. Since the thesis work is somewhat lighter now, I'm able to focus more on this course as well.
