what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to better understand the concrete steps necessary in order to deliver the product we've decided to build.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I have a good understanding of how network effects and two-sided markets work, as well as the logistics and transport sector in general. Conveying this to the team can be a good contribution.

what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Marginal at this time as I am still learning scrum.

what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? 
Finding a workable business model around the suggested project is my biggest contribution at this time.
