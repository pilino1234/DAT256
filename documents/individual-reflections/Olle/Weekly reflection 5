What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I understand kivy quite well but can't contribute much since the front end development is basically done. 

B: I want to learn firebase so I can work on the backend.

A -> B: I will take on a firebase related back-end issue for the next sprint

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: I can contribute by helping people question whether what they are doing is adding value.

B: I want to be able to help someone with programming related stuff.

A -> B: I can try to work more with Kevin so we can learn together.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
A: As a product owner, I am trying to see whether what people are doing is adding value in a way that makes sense to the end user.

B: I want to contribute more.

A -> B: I will try to work more with Kevin and maybe come up with new issues with the front end that might add value.
        That way there will be front end stuff to review, the desigh of which the end user will actually care about.
        This is however a complete U-turn compared to the mvp thought process we are trying to adopt which feels a bit dumb.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: Me and Kevin did some programming and finished the User Profile view and some related front end Edit functionality

B: I need to learn firebase or find more front end stuff to do.

A -> B: I will discuss with Kevin if we should learn firebase together or find new front end functionality to design.
