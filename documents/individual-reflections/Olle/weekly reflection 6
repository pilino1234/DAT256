What do I want to learn or understand better?
A: I'm currently only doing front end

B: I would like to learn firebase which we're using for the back end.

A -> B: Me learning back end does not make sense this late in the project so I will not learn that.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A: I can contribute by helping people question whether what they are doing is adding value.

B: I would like to do this more, I feel like that's needed. I feel like my relative inability to program makes my opinion irrelevant though.

A -> B: I'm trying to still give my feedback on these sorts of issues anyways.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
A: As a product owner, I am trying to see whether what people are doing is adding value in a way that makes sense to the end user. I'm also
    working together with kevin on issues which helps us be productive as product owners together.

B: I feel like this works well.

A -> B: -

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: Me and kevin are working together on the filter/search functionality for the delivery list.

B: This is working well and we are productive.

A -> B: -
