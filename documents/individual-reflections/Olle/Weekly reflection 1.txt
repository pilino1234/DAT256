What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to better understand how a software engineering project is coordinated and just generally learn more programming to do cool stuff.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think my contribution as an I-student will be to help the group focus on what is value-adding and what is not. Perhaps my experience generally doing a lot of projects will come to some use as well.


What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
None so far. At this point I'm just trying to understand how scrum works and what it is.


What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I have tried to see the business potential (or in some cases lack thereof) in the ideas that have come up from various points of view. Just generally trying to see how the ideas may be possible.
