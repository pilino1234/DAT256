-   I want to better learn to accept tasks that I actually feel that I have the time to complete. When I work in a project, there's often the scenario that I put on to much work where I either have to stress and put in extra hours to complete or sadly fail some or all of my tasks. I want to improve my ability to accurately predict what I can finish.

-   I am a person that loves to learn certain stuff in details, I feel like I can contribute there by using my earlier experiences since I like to program outside of school as well.

-   I love to discuss challenges and try to dissect them into smaller problems. I am good at finding potential issues with a solution before implementing them, that's a good strength from me.

-   I can provide clear PRs and clear commits along with good code to make it easier for my teammates to know what I am doing to either help me or read my code to easier criticize me.

I haven't been able to work a ton this week due to other school engangements and moving from home. But next week will be more calmer.
