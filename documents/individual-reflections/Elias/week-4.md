# Individual Reflection

### Week 4

-   **What do I want to learn or understand better?**

    **A**: I would still like to understand firebase better. I didn't find an oportunity to learn it with Theodor this week. 
    
    **B**: Understand firebase, so that I can effectively increase the value and functionality of the app. 
    
    **A->B**: I'll try to either look for documentation on my own, or see if Theodor has time to explain things next week. 

-   **How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

    **A**: I helped Kevin integrate some Kivy code into our app, I also showed him the basics of using KivyMD.
    
    **B**: I want to be available as a resource to help the rest of the team if there is something I know which they don't.
    
    **A->B**: Keep up with the daily scrums and see if people have problems which I can help with. 
    Also try to learn new things so that I can improve my ability to help out. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?**

    **A**: I feel like we're currently doing all the things we should to properly follow scrum.
    
    **B**: I want us to use scrum properly, since it's the primary point of this entire course.
    
    **A-B**: I should pay attention to wether or not we diverge from any agile principles, 
    and in that case try to resolve the issue quickly, so that we can stay on the right track. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

    **A**: I worked on a prototype for uploading photos from the device storage, I also helped Kevin as previously mentioned. 
    
    **B**: I would like the team to deliver a proper app which delivers real value. 
    
    **A->B**: The backend (firebase) things have been a bottle neck so far, so next week I'll try to focus on connecting the different
    components of the app to firebase so that they are synchronized with the backend data.
