# Individual Reflection

### Week 7
-   **What do I want to learn or understand better?**

    **A**: The development part of the course is nearing its end, and we will present the app on Monday. Before then I have a
    little time which I can use for learning how to get a product ready for showcasing. In general, from the course so far I've 
    learned a lot about how to apply agile principles, the value of reflections and regular meetings with the team. As well as some
    new technologies which I might use in the future.
    
    **B**: Next week I hope to gain some experience about how to best showcase a product, and also how to collect thoughts, reflections
    and experiences from a larger span of time and condense that into some useful principles which can then be applied to future projects.
    
    **A->B**: With the remaining time I will prepare for the presentation, work on the final assignment and discuss more generally 
    with the team what we have learned from working on this project. 

-   **How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

    **A**: It seems like Olle and Kevin need help getting the app to run on their computers, it hadn't really caught my attention 
    until today. On the other hand they seem content with the current situation, and there is lots of non-coding-related work which 
    needs to be done now regardless, so I don't know if it is worth spending time on. I'll help if they ask of course. 
    
    **B**: I want to be available as a resource to help the rest of the team if there is something I know which they don't.
    
    **A->B**: Keep up with the daily scrums and see if people have problems which I can help with. 
    Also try to learn new things so that I can improve my ability to help out. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?**

    **A**: I feel like we're currently doing all the things we should to properly follow scrum.
   I'm doing my part by participating in the daily scrum, sprint reviews, reflections and meetings.  
    
    **B**: I want us to use scrum properly, since it's the primary point of this entire course.
    
    **A-B**: I should pay attention to wether or not we diverge from any agile principles, 
    and in that case try to resolve the issue quickly, so that we can stay on the right track. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

    **A**: This week I've worked on an assortment of smaller issues needed to get the app ready for the demo. I've also contributed a little
    to the "script" which we will use for the presentation. Last but not least I've reviewed pull requests and things as usual 
    
    **B**: I want the app to be ready for the demo, and I want to feel that my contributions have played an important role in that being the case.
    I also aim to contribute and pull my own weight on the final written assignments. 
    
    **A->B**: I will spend what little time I have left before the demo to make sure that it is ready on time. I will also work towards getting
    the assignments done as early as possible next week.
