# Individual Reflection

### Week 5

-   **What do I want to learn or understand better?**

    **A**: I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the tools we are working with now, one thing I haven't looked at yet is how we should go about adding a map to the application.
    
    **B**: I want the knowledge and experience to implement all features planned for the application. 
    
    **A->B**: I'll look at some documentation about how to add maps to kivy next week. 

-   **How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

    **A**: No one has needed help this week, which is good. 
    
    **B**: I want to be available as a resource to help the rest of the team if there is something I know which they don't.
    
    **A->B**: Keep up with the daily scrums and see if people have problems which I can help with. 
    Also try to learn new things so that I can improve my ability to help out. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?**

    **A**: I feel like we're currently doing all the things we should to properly follow scrum.
   I'm doing my part by participating in the daily scrum, sprint reviews, reflections and meetings.  
    
    **B**: I want us to use scrum properly, since it's the primary point of this entire course.
    
    **A-B**: I should pay attention to wether or not we diverge from any agile principles, 
    and in that case try to resolve the issue quickly, so that we can stay on the right track. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

    **A**: I've been having some difficulty getting progress done on my issues, since they have depended on other things being done.
    I've done as much work as I currently can on photo uploading. I also helped out a bit with Jacob's "accept-delivery" task.
    I'll try to finish my issues over the weekend. 
    
    **B**: I would like the team to deliver a proper app which delivers real value. 
    
    **A->B**: When planning the next sprint I'd like to pay some extra attention to how tasks depend on eachother, so that everyone can work better in parallel.
