# Individual Reflection
### Week 2

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * Next week I want to learn about map APIs and other libraries that can be used for the carrepsa app.
    I would also like to get started with the development to better understand the overall architecture of the app and backend.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  * Same as last week.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * This week some user stories were written. I didn't participate in that a lot myself, but I looked through them when designing the GUI mockup. 
    Next week I believe these user stories will be divided into smaller tasks, at which point the actual Scrum process will begin. 

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * Jimmy and I made a Google Slides presentation with a GUI design mockup this week.
    Initially we tried to learn Adobe XD, but that didn't work too well for us, so we ended up wasting some time on that.
    I've also been fairly active in Slack, but my response time could probably improve a bit.
