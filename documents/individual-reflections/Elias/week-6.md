# Individual Reflection

### Week 6

-   **What do I want to learn or understand better?**

    **A**: The project is approaching its end, and there isn't a lot of time left to learn new things technology-wise. 
    We are now in a situation where features need to be prioritized so that we have a product which creates value by the end of the course, 
    which could potentially be educational in its own ways.
    
    **B**: I want to know how to apply agile principles in order to deliver a valuable product in very limited time.  
    
    **A->B**: Next sprint meeting I'll discuss with the rest of the group how we can most efficiently finalize the app for the demo. 

-   **How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

    **A**: No one has needed help this week, which is good. 
    
    **B**: I want to be available as a resource to help the rest of the team if there is something I know which they don't.
    
    **A->B**: Keep up with the daily scrums and see if people have problems which I can help with. 
    Also try to learn new things so that I can improve my ability to help out. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?**

    **A**: I feel like we're currently doing all the things we should to properly follow scrum.
   I'm doing my part by participating in the daily scrum, sprint reviews, reflections and meetings.  
    
    **B**: I want us to use scrum properly, since it's the primary point of this entire course.
    
    **A-B**: I should pay attention to wether or not we diverge from any agile principles, 
    and in that case try to resolve the issue quickly, so that we can stay on the right track. 

-   **What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

    **A**: Photo uploading is done, I've also made an interface for user authentication and improved code coverage.  
    
    **B**: I want to do my part in ensuring we have a good, valuable app to demo by the end of the course. 
    
    **A->B**: As stated in 1. Next sprint meeting I'll discuss with the rest of the group how we can most efficiently finalize the app for the demo.
