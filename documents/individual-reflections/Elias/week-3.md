# Individual Reflection
### Week 3

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  *  **A:** I'm not too familiar with workig with ".kv" files or Firebase
  *  **B:** I want to have a good grasp of the afforementioned tools.
  *  **A→B:** We will decide in the team if we should use ".kv" files or stick to pure python code. In the former case I will make an effort (maybe do some examples) to learn how to use it properly. 
              I will also try to look at some firebase stuff with Theodor and do at least one of the related tasks for this sprint. 
              
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  *  **A:** I know that there is still some uncertainty about git and Kivy.
  *  **B:** I want everyone to be comfortable with the tools we use in the project. 
  *  **A→B:** I offer my help whenever possible. 

  
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  *  **A:** I think we already do a decent job with Scrum. One area of improvement is that we currently haven't estimated the effort for each of the tasks.
  *  **B:** I want us to use scrum properly, since it's the primary point of this entire course.
  *  **A→B:** We realized together when doing the weekly reflections that the effort estimation will be important, at least if we want to have some kind of velocity based KPI. 
     on monday we will estimate the tasks for the current sprint. 

  
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  *  **A:** I've added KivyMD to the project and implemented a navbar with a fab based on this. I've also attended meetings and have been active in Slack etc. as usual. 
  *  **B:** I want to contribute more on the backend stuff, beyond that I just want to maintain my current level of activity 
  *  **A→B:** As previously mentioned, I'll try to learn more about firebase and implement some of the related tasks.
