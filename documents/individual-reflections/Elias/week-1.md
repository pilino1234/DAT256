# Individual Reflection Week 1

* what do I want to learn or understand better? 
  *I would like to learn Kivy and other fameworks that we will use in the project.*
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
  *I should be able to help if anyone has questions about python, git, or project ideas.*
* what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum? 
  *We've only done the Lego exercise so far, which I think was a good warm-up for when we apply it for real in the coming weeks.*
* what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? 
  *I made a PDF which detailed one possible project idea. I have been present during all lectures, exercises and meetings etc. I've also been available on Slack.*
