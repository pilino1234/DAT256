What do I want to learn or understand better?
 A: This week Olle and I was assigned two issues that he had started on in the last sprint. Python is still
 challenging for me, so Olle explained how his code worked and what he had done so far. This week me and Olle 
 was assigned product owners, so I would like to learn even more about the product owner role.
 B: Still need to work with understanding Python and our program better. 
 A->B: Working more with the project, looking up information and asking for help when needed and also learn 
 on my own. 

How can I help somoeone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 A: I helped Olle with how to make some icons and how to get them into his view. I want to be able to help as much
 as I can. Onwards, I would like to be more active with reviewing stuff. I'm not really in a position where I can 
 review the structure of the code/how neat the code is, but of course I can review the functionality.
 B: Learn more and help as much as I can with what I know.
 A->B: Try to answer questions when I can. The group is very skilled, but will do what I can.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
 A: Was part of reviewing our first sprint, doing all my daily reflections and onwards being the product owner. 
 B: Getting more experience with Scrum and being product owner.
 A->B: Keep working and learn more.

What is my contribution to the team deliveries?
 A: Last week I finished the delivery request view that is now integrated into our dev. This week I did some pair 
 programming with Olle and we finished his issues (the user profile view & function). We have looked everything 
 through and made pull requests. This week I took a more active role in the team reflection; me and Olle started
 on our own with the reflection and tried to make a good base.
 B: Taking on new issues next week, maybe polish on the user profile in case it is needed. 
 A->B: Keep working like I do and learn more.
