What do I want to learn or understand better?
 Continously learning more about the softwares we will develop the application in. I want to be as prepared as possible before 
 we start developing the application.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 As I mentioned last week, I am one of the Industrial Engineering students, so my relative strength are within those areas. 
 This week we had to make a bussiness model canvas, which I had some experience in from before that I was able to share.

What is my countribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
 I have attended to the lectures this week where we talked more about Scrum. I have also actively taken part in our 
 group meetings where we have discussed Scrum.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
 This week we decided to divide some of the tasks. I was responsible of creating the business model canvas, which I did. 
 Earlier this day, we also had the opportunity to pitch our project ideas. Our group decided that we wanted to pitch our idea,
 and I was one of the presenters.
