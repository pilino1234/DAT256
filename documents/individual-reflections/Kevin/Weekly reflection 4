What do I want to learn or understand better?
 A: Before the Easter holiday, I felt like I was having trouble to understand the framework of our
 program. So I asked for some help. Elias and I did some pair programming on one of my issues from the 
 morning til lunch, and then I finished the rest in the afternoon. I am really glad that he helped and
 it helped me understand the program better. 
 B: I have improved on Kivy, but with Python, I feel like still am not getting everything yet. So I need
 to learn Python and our program better.
 A->B: To get from A to B. I feel like I'm getting better by working with the project. Since it was very
 helpful to have some help to get started I think I will probably ask for a bit help to get started the 
 coming week as well! 

How can I help somoeone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 A: So far, I think I've been the one who has needed help, which I've got. Since I finished a view,
 I would be able to help with some questions when others are working with similar views.
 B: Be as helpful as I can with the knowledge that I've got.
 A->B: Being available as much as possible and being open to questions. However, I'm in a group with
 highly skilled IT-students, but I will of course help with anything that I can.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
 A: We have a daily scrum bot in Slack that I use. So is everyone else. Our first sprint is coming to an
 end as well.
 B: Getting more experience with Scrum.
 A->B: Keep working as we do to learn more.

What is my contribution to the team deliveries?
 A: Finished a view with some help from Elias to get started.
 B: Taking on new issues.
 A->B: Keep working like I do and learn more.
