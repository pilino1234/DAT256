What do I want to learn or understand better?
 My current knowledge within programming so far is within Java and SQL. In order to do this project, I want to
 learn new aspects of programming. So far we have talked about using Kivy, YAPF and Sphinx. I also want to learn 
 more about how Scrum works, since the concept is completely new to me. I am also interested in learning how it 
 actually is to develop a real software and how the process will be like.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 * Since I am and Industrial engineering student, my realtive strength is within those areas. I believe that I can
 contribute and share a perspective of how to add value. I also have some knowledge of Canvas from before that I 
 can share.
 * I have a decent understanding for Java and SQL. I believe that the IT-students are way more experienced and talanted
 with the programs, but perhaps there might be at least something that I know that is new to them.


What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
 We haven't really gotten that far with Scrum yet. However, I was taking part of the lectures and Lego-exercise. I've
 tried to understand and grasp the mindset.


What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
 I took part in making the social contract. We also had one delivery of coming up with a project idea, which I have done.
 Besides from that, we have not had any specific deliveries yet.
