# Individual Reflection Week 1

* what do I want to learn or understand better? *The frameworks and libraries we plan to use in the project such as Kivy, YAPF and Sphinx.*
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? *Since I have previous experience of python I made an example project for the Carrepsa project idea proposal to show how such a project might look like.*
* what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum? *So far we've mainly done the lego exercise, which was fun. I think everyone in the group got a better understandment of each other and learned both how to collaborate in general and how to apply Scrum.*
* what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? *I participated in all the lectures exercises. I made a proposal branch we're I created a base for the Carrepsa idea. Active in Slack and such.*
